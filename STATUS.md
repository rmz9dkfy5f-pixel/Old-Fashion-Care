## Completed This Push — Merge (2026-07-06)

Merged `migration/project-starter-v3-3` into `main` (`--no-ff`, real merge commit, not a
fast-forward). The two branches had diverged since 2026-06-30: `main` had picked up its own commit
(`76ea00e`, tagged `v1.6.0`/`v1.6.1`, adding the refined handoff-prompt file) while the migration
branch continued independently with 4 more commits ending in `5a7abc8` (SEO audit + Production
Readiness Skills deployment, tag `v1.5.5`).

- `git merge-tree` dry run (read-only, performed before merging) showed exactly 3 real conflicts:
  `COMMIT_NOTES.md`, `PROGRESS_NOTES.md`, `STATUS.md` — all append-style logs both branches had
  added different entries to. No conflicts in any HTML/CSS file or in `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/`,
  `docs/governance/`, `docs/project/` (main didn't have those paths at all — clean additions).
  `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` and the handoff-prompt file auto-merged cleanly (only one side had changed
  each).
- Resolved the 3 conflicts by combining both sides' entries (no content dropped) rather than
  picking one side.
- Pre-merge safety snapshot of `main` taken at
  `/Volumes/AntNVMe1TB/WorkSync/Projects/RepoBackups/Old-Fashion-Care/v1.6.1__pre-v2-merge-snapshot__commit-76ea00e`
  (223 files, verified against `git ls-tree`).

**Production Readiness Skills deployment (now on main):**
- Project Starter Kit V3.4 baseline (migrate mode) — additive only; `v34_validate.py` → PASS.
  3 real conflicts (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ai/agents/AGENT_REVIEW_GATES.md`) quarantined into
  `.v34_migration_review/*.v34-candidate` for manual review — existing files untouched.
- 18-skill production-readiness suite installed into `.claude/skills/` (22 total skills: 4 V3.4 +
  18 PR suite). No name conflicts.
- New top-level additions: `.agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `docs/governance/`, `docs/project/`,
  `ai/agents/SUBAGENT_ROLES.md`, `ai/prompts/*`, `00_MIGRATION_KICKOFF.md`, `MIGRATION_REPORT.md`,
  `V34_INSTALL_REPORT.json`.
- Known overlap: `docs/project/*.md` (new, from V3.4) duplicates the root-level tracking docs
  already in active use in this repo — not yet reconciled.

**SEO audit (now on main):**

SEO audit across `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `how-it-works.html`,
`questions.html`, `contact.html`:

- Titles, meta descriptions, canonical URLs, Open Graph tags, Twitter Card tags, `sitemap.xml`,
  and `robots.txt` were already correct and consistent across all 6 pages.
- **Fixed:** `og:image` / `twitter:image` on all 6 pages pointed to `images/og-default.png`, which
  does not exist in the repo (broken link-preview image on Facebook/LinkedIn/iMessage/X for every
  page). Repointed to the existing `images/hero-ai.jpg` and corrected `og:image:width`/`:height`
  from the placeholder 1200×630 to the file's actual 1100×934.
- **Fixed:** `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/images/apple-touch-icon.png">` on all 6 pages
  referenced a file that does not exist (broken iOS "Add to Home Screen" icon). Removed the tag;
  browsers fall back to the existing `favicon.svg`.
- Verified: no other local `href`/`src` references across the 6 pages point to missing files.

## Completed Previously (c04e819 — 2026-06-30)

Three hero CSS iterations completed and pushed since last handoff (a2e7c9a):

**ea8b067** — Hero gradient further left (B-period anchor) + wider sub overlap:
- `.hero::after` gradient stops shifted so opacity ≈0.50 at the B-period position (x≈510, 33%)
- `.hero__sub` max-width 582→648px — lower text lines clearly overlap caregiver's arm/shoulder/hand
- Verified desktop 1554×900 + mobile 390×820

**b195aba** — Hero smoother gradient + headline 1-line fix + sub barely-covers-hand:
- `.hero__headline` max-width 565→620px — fixed "We make that possible." regression to 2 lines
- `.hero::after` 10-stop smooth gradient; visible fade anchored at 'h' in "where" (~22%); seam at 46% covered at 0.26 opacity
- `.hero__sub` font-size 0.97→0.94rem, max-width 648→580px — lines barely reach hand, shoulder uncovered
- Verified desktop 1554×900 + mobile 390×820

**c04e819** — Handoff tracking docs (this commit):
- CHANGELOG.md: v1.5.0 entry added
- SLICE_REVIEWS.md: 2026-06-30 entry added
- PROGRESS_NOTE.md: updated to current state

Tag `v1.5.0__hero-smoother-gradient-headline-fix__commit-b195aba` applied to b195aba and pushed.
Snapshot saved to RepoBackups for b195aba.

## Current Blocker

> None.

---

## Next Action

> 1. Push the merge commit + `v2.0.0` tag to origin (Netlify redeploys from main automatically).
> 2. Review the 3 quarantined `.v34_migration_review/` candidates and decide whether to merge any
>    content into `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`ai/agents/AGENT_REVIEW_GATES.md`.
> 3. Reconcile `docs/project/*.md` with the existing root-level tracking docs.
> 4. Swap in hi-res hero photo before final launch (separate known issue).

## Last Verified Working State

```text
Merge of 5a7abc8 (migration/project-starter-v3-3, tag v1.5.5) and 76ea00e (main, tag v1.6.1) — main — 2026-07-06
Hero: smoother 10-stop gradient starting at 'h' in "where" (22%); orange headline 1 line (620px);
4-line sub barely reaches hand, shoulder visible; no seam; mobile clean.
SEO metadata fixed (og-image, apple-touch-icon); V3.4 baseline + 18-skill suite installed.
GitHub repo: Old-Fashion-Care — git@github.com:rmz9dkfy5f-pixel/Old-Fashion-Care.git
All 6 pages load correctly; Netlify auto-deploy active on main branch.
```

## Validation Performed This Push

```text
Static site — no build/lint scripts.
Merge (2026-07-06): git merge-tree dry run identified exactly 3 conflicts before merging; all
resolved by combining both sides' content (verified no <<<<<<</=======/>>>>>>> markers remain
post-resolution). Pre- and post-merge snapshots taken and verified by file count against
git ls-tree. v34_validate.py re-run on main post-merge. Local href/src resolution sweep re-run
across all 6 pages post-merge.

SEO audit (2026-07-05): grep-based inventory of <title>/meta description/canonical/OG/Twitter tags
across all 6 pages — all correct prior to this session. Confirmed images/og-default.png and
images/apple-touch-icon.png referenced but missing via `ls`. Post-fix: grep confirms zero remaining
references to og-default.png or apple-touch-icon.png; a scripted check of every local href/src
across all 6 pages confirms every referenced local file now exists.

Production Readiness Skills install (2026-07-05): `python3 v34_validate.py --target .` → PASS
(no missing required files, no skill errors). `find .claude/skills -name SKILL.md | wc -l` → 22
(expected). `grep -rl "Smart Learning" .claude/skills/` → clean after fix. `git status --short`
confirms no existing tracked file was modified/deleted by either installer — all changes are new
files plus the 3 quarantined candidates.
```

## Open Questions

- [ ] Which photos from care-07 through care-11 should replace any in the current grid?
- [ ] Should a dedicated apple-touch-icon.png (180×180) be created later, or is the favicon.svg
      fallback acceptable long-term?
- [ ] How should `docs/project/*.md` (new from V3.4) be reconciled with the existing root-level
      tracking docs — keep both, or fold one into the other?
- [ ] Review the 3 quarantined files in `.v34_migration_review/` and decide whether any content
      from the V3.4 candidates should be merged into the existing `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`.
